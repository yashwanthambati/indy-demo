## Indy-demo

Hyperledger Indy was Hyperledger’s first "**identity-focused**" blockchain framework, joining Hyperledger in 2017. The code for Indy was contributed by the **Sovrin Foundation**, an organization that we’ll cover a little later, after we’ve dug a bit deeper into Indy.

Indy is a purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identity. Indy includes verifiable credentials based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, decentralized identifiers, a software development kit (SDK) for building agents and an implementation of a public, permissioned distributed ledger.

What are verifiable credentials ?
what are DIDs() ?
