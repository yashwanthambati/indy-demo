## Indy-demo

Hyperledger Indy was Hyperledger’s first "**identity-focused**" blockchain framework, joining Hyperledger in 2017. The code for Indy was contributed by the **Sovrin Foundation**, an organization that we’ll cover a little later, after we’ve dug a bit deeper into Indy.

Indy is a purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identity. Indy includes verifiable credentials based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, decentralized identifiers, a software development kit (SDK) for building agents and an implementation of a public, permissioned distributed ledger.Indy, Aries and Ursa make the Hyperledger Identity "Stack."

### Concepts

- What are verifiable credentials ?
- What are DIDs() ?
- What is zero-knowledge proof(ZKP) ?
